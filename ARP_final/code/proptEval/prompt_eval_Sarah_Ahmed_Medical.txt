Sample outputs from optimized_structured:
Question: How are you feeling today?
  1) I am feeling quite neutral today, neither high nor low. My body and mind are simply going about their routine.
  2) Today, my state is stable and unremarkable. Nothing specific is causing me discomfort or particular joy at this moment.
  3) My feelings are fairly balanced today, a steady state. I'm simply here, observing things as they unfold.
